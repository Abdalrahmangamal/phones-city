    # Samsung S24 Ultra Component Fixes Summary

    ## Issues Fixed

    ### 1. AppDownloadSection Responsive Issues
    **Problem**: The AppDownloadSection was not properly responsive and hidden on mobile devices.
    **Solution**: 
    - Added a mobile-friendly version that displays on smaller screens
    - Made the height responsive with `min-h-[530px] md:h-[530px]`
    - Added mobile-specific layout with centered content and appropriately sized elements
    - Kept the desktop version hidden on mobile with `hidden md:block`
    - Added a mobile version with `md:hidden` that shows a simplified layout

    ### 2. FrameSection Overlapping Text Issue
    **Problem**: The "متجر موثّق رسميًا" feature card had overlapping text due to fixed heights.
    **Solution**:
    - Changed `md:h-[130px] h-[100px]` to `min-h-[130px]` to allow flexible height
    - Applied the same fix to all feature cards to prevent similar issues
    - This ensures content doesn't overflow and maintains proper spacing

    ### 3. S24 Ultra Specific Component Improvements
    **Problem**: S24 Ultra components needed better responsive behavior.
    **Solution**:
    - Updated S24FrameSection to use `min-h-[130px]` instead of fixed heights
    - Improved S24AppDownloadSection positioning and sizing for better display
    - Enhanced CSS media queries for more accurate S24 Ultra detection

    - Added proper responsive classes for all elements

    ### FrameSection.tsx
